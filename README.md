SurfWatch Labs API Quickstarter : Real-time API Server
==========================

This repository contains sample code snippets to demonstrate the basic API interactions available from the [SurfWatch Labs Real-time API](https://www.surfwatchlabs.com/surfwatch-analytics-api).  These snippets should serve as an example only for the basic API functions, and do not provide additional functionality that will be crucial to the success of your application ( e.g. reconnect logic, complying with rate limits, etc. ).  For more details on these and other real-time examples, visit the [SurfWatch Labs API Real-time Quickstart](https://www.surfwatchlabs.com/tech-docs/quick-start/realtime) page.

Usage
=====

The examples can be run with [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html), [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download) or [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/installation/).  The dependent libraries were chosen for convenience only; depending on your needs any combination of http server and serialization libraries can be leveraged.
